- Who am I?
I'm 25, studied politics, middle eastern studies, creative writing,
I've worked in a hotel, as a theater steward, as a martial arts school assistant manager, as a university  resident advisor/residential life coordinator, as a maths and english tutor

But programming!

You've all made the same career-changing decision. It's scary huh?

- there is a drop off in energy, it's easy to feel less motivated => go to events.
- I work much harder against tight deadlines => push yourself in short hackathon-esque sprints.
- A good a analogy is that great actors always get rejected constantly. It's simply not about how good you are, just are you a good fit, and everyone CAN'T be a good fit for every place. The company is better at judging this than you are.

- I applied to a a few different places, mostly through Makers, a couple outside. I preferred to go down a more software developing route rather than web developing.

- The role of Alumni Helpers is being phased out, probably for the best. I spent 6 weeks having a great time, and I really enjoy the mentoring/educational aspect of the role. But it distracted me from jobhunting. I still interviewed and applied, but I did more when that ended.

- I've had whiteboarding interviews where my mind blanked. I'm better at problem-solving through a feedback loop. Whiteboarding there is none. IMO it's a terrible terrible way to interview.

- I've had phone interviews

- I've had tech tests i've completed, and been rejected, ones I never completed, ones I completed and never heard back from.

- the current job I had was in three steps. I had an in-person meeting with the head of development, with a technical interview that was a pairing session, much like the takeaway challenge. the till kind of tech tests are pretty common. So revisit it! do it again TDD in ruby and Javascript and think about how to apply best practices to it! then I had a meeting with the head of talent/HR to discuss more of the culture fit, and then I was offered a job, which i deliberated on.

- it's important to recognise everyone feels and is under different pressures. I liked being uncommitted. I was worried about being stuck in something I didn't like in in an industry I had never done before. It was anxiety inducing. So I asked to spend a whole day at their offices, which are coincidentally right round the corner on brick lane. I chatted and sat down with the guys. because IMO the team fit is far more important that the product, the stack, the salary or the location. Conveniently all were pretty good!
